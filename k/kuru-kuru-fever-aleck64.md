## 🕹️ Game Description
If you're familiar with Puyo Puyo then you'll likely pick up on this game pretty quickly. In this game you match different fruit, create combos, and send garbage over to your opponent in the hopes that they'll eventually fill up their play area and have no room left. What makes this different from Puyo Puyo is that each character has a favourite fruit and clearing that one will cause the play area to flip upside down. Any subsequent matches will cause further flips and this reduces the number of fruits needed for a match. Two different modes are available, Story Mode and Challenge Mode. In Story Mode you pick a character and work your way up defeating all the other characters in the game. Challenge Mode is essentially score attack where you see how long you can keep going. A second player can join in on either of these modes but you won't be able to advance the Story that way. This game has some English text and some Japanese text. The instructions on how to play are all in Japanese but everything else is English. Playing this game should be no problem for an English speaker.
