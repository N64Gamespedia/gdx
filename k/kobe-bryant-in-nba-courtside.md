## 🕹️ Game Description
Kobe Bryant in NBA Courtside is a basketball simulation game for the Nintendo 64. It was released in 1998 and received a Player's Choice designation after selling one-million copies. Kobe Bryant was in his second NBA season at the time of the game's release and was the youngest player to have a game to his namesake. Kobe Bryant in NBA Courtside features 5-on-5 game play. The game also features 1997-1998 rosters (except for Michael Jordan, who was not in the players' association and is renamed "Roster Player #98"). There are three game options: Exhibition, Season, and Playoffs. The game allows you to either simulate Season games or play them to lead into the playoffs, and win the NBA Finals.
