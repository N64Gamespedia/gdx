## 🕹️ Game Description
John Romero's Daikatana is composed of twenty-four levels divided into four episodes. The number of maps per level varies but is generally about three. Each episode represents a different location and time period: futuristic Japan, ancient Greece, the Dark Ages in Norway and near-future San Francisco. Gameplay tends towards fast-paced combat, although an attempt at introducing problem-solving elements was also included. It was also an exclusive release to the video store chain Blockbusters.
