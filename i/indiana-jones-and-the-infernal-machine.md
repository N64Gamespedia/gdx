## 🕹️ Game Description
The main objective of the game is to collect four machine parts in order to complete the titular Infernal Machine. The story of the game is set in 1947 and depicts archaeologist and adventurer Indiana Jones returning to his digging career after the turbulent World War II conflicts he was involved in. Sophia Hapgood, an old friend of Indiana and now a member of the Central Intelligence Agency, visits him at his dig site in the Canyonlands, and informs him that the Russians are excavating the ruins of Babylon. Led by Dr. Gennadi Volodnikov, a physicist interested in alternate dimensions, the Soviets' supposed objective is to find a weapon more powerful than the atom bomb, giving them a deciding advantage in the Cold War. It was also an exclusive release to the video store chain Blockbusters. In addition to being available to rent or buy at Blockbuster stores, customers could also order the game straight from LucasArts' website.
