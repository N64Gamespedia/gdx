## üïπÔ∏è Game Description
In essence, the game is quite the same as its Super NES predecessor, International Superstar Soccer Deluxe, vastly upgraded for the Nintendo 64, with 3D animation, fluid and fast-paced gameplay. While it kept largely the same team roster (with the teams now sporting near-authentic kits), South Africa debuted in this game as a selectable side, replacing Morocco. However, the Japanese version of ISS 64 has teams that are not present in the overseas versions, such as Bolivia, Yugoslavia, Canada and Saudi Arabia. There are six game modes, including a fun multiplayer 1-4 player (except for everyone's icons being the same color) exhibition mode and training. International Cup has the player competing against a range of teams from around the world in a round robin tournament; World League is a series of 70 matches against every one of other teams in the game. The player can also contest a penalty shoot-out competition with up to 4 players, or attempt to complete certain scenario games (where each game is set up with a specific goal, for example scoring a goal within a given time limit, or stopping the opposing team from scoring, etc.).
