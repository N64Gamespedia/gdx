## 🕹️ Game Description

_**Carmageddon 64**_ is a racing game developed by Software Creations for the Nintendo 64. The game is noted for it’s emphasis on vehicular violence as a majority of the game revolves around creating as much chaos as possible. In Carmageddon, the player races a vehicle against a number of other computer controlled competitors in various settings, including city, mine and industrial areas. The player has a certain amount of time to complete each race, but more time may be gained by collecting bonuses, damaging the competitors’ cars, or by running over pedestrians. Checkpoints do not extend the time limit and races are completed by either completing the course as one would a normal racing game, “wasting” (wrecking) all other race cars, or killing all pedestrians on the level. The game includes thirty six race tracks, played across eleven different locations.
