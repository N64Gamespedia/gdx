## 🕹️ Game Description

_**Carnivale – Cenzo’s Adventure**_ was developed by Terraglyph Interactive Studios, but was a cancelled for the Nintendo 64 based on the animated film by the same name. The film only received a small limited release within Europe and was centered around a group of children who were transported through a portal to another dimension, where they found a magical amusement park. They must figure out a way to escape the amusement park before they are turned into rides and trapped forever. The game itself was first shown off at E3 1999, and was noted for being pretty incomplete. It mainly consisted of grinding silver (and the rarer gold) coins to play various carnival games such as duck shooting, high striker, and racing. Due to financial issues within Terraglyph, they were eventually forced to pull the plug on the project, leaving it unfinished. A huge thank you to Forest of Illusion for this release!
