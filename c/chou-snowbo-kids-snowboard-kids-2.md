## üïπÔ∏è Game Description
Snow Town is under attack by a 10-year old terror named Damien, and it's up to the Snowboard Kids to defeat him. Pick your character from a pack of nine rabid pre-teens, each with different attributes that gives him or her advantages on specific slopes. In this sequel to Snowboard Kids, you can play in either Story mode or Action mode, depending on how involved you want to get. The 3D courses at your disposal include "Sunny Mountain," "Turtle Island," "Jingle Town," "Wendy's House," "Linda's Castle," and "Crazy Jungle." The obstacles are varied and extremely difficult, ranging from potholes to waterfalls. While having a number of similarities to its predecessor, this installment has more weaponry and games than you can possibly imagine. Good for up to four players, and Rumble Pak compatible.
