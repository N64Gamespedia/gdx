## 🕹️ Game Description
*ClayFighter 63⅓* is a zany beat 'em up, clay animated fighters clash in a fight to the clay death. Characters such as Bad Mr. Frosty (a snowman gone terribly bad), Blob (a green pile of slime), Bonker the nightmare clown and a host more are available to choose from, each with a range of moves that no clay animated character has ever attempted before (such as throwing chickens, clay, and plenty of other objects, including themselves). Graphics are a combination of 2D clay animated characters and 3D designed foregrounds/backgrounds.

*ClayFighter: Sculptor's Cut* is an updated version of ClayFighter 63⅓, both from the Nintendo 64. The same story and characters from the previous game remained, though now it had some additional features such as new characters, though some things, like certain character moves, were removed. It also featured Lockjaw Pooch, who was thought to be deceased. It was also an exclusive release to the video store chain Blockbuster.
