## 🕹️ Game Description  
While *Cruis'n USA* takes the player on a trip across the highways of America, *Cruis'n World* leads them to race all around the world. Courses, taken from the coin-op version, are located in: Egypt, Florida, Germany, Hawaii, Russia (in easy mode); England, France, Kenya, New York (in medium mode); Australia, China, Italy, Mexico (in expert mode). The gameplay is not intended to be realistic. It is for instance possible to ride across the Great Wall of China, leap-frog over a semi truck with a police car, or perform a back flip with a military ATV, or take part in a race on the moon. The N64 version offers two-player and tournament modes, a special course on the Moon, the possibility to enhance cars with custom boosts and alter its appearance by paintworks, and does not use the sound effects from the previous game.
