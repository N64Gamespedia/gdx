## 🕹️ Game Description
<em><strong>Chou Kuukan Night: Pro Yakyuu King</strong></em> is a baseball game with anime graphics. The featured teams are from the Japanese professional league. The two main playing modes are exhibition matches, with a number of options to set (e.g. number of players or the field type), and playing a whole season including an athlete trade option. Each athlete has a number of statistics which influence his performance on the field. Those statistics can be improved by using an athlete in the practice mode. Here the player trains in different baseball activities (batting, catching, out-fielding, pitching and in-fielding) with varying difficulty levels. During the match, the athletes are controlled directly by the player.
