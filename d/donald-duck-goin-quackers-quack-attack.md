## üïπÔ∏è Game Description
You play as Donald in this 3D platform action game. Donald's girlfriend, Daisy is a reporter for a television station in Duckberg. While doing a story on the secret temple of the terrible magician Merlock, Daisy is kidnapped. Now, it is up to Donald to get her back. Along the way he will have help from his nephews, Huey, Dewey, and Louie, and the inventor Gyro Gearloose. He will also have competition from Gladstone Gander, who is also trying to save Daisy. Game play alternates between side-scrolling running and jumping and 3D running and jumping. The side-scrolling levels play a lot like the Super Mario Bros. games. The 3D levels are more akin to the Crash Bandicoot series of games. All in all, there are 20 levels spread out through various areas.
