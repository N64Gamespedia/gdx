## 🕹️ Game Description
The prototype of the unreleased Doubutsu Banchou (also known as Animal Leader, or Cubivore on GameCube) for the Nintendo 64. Only shown at Space World 2000, this game was originally meant for the 64DD add on. The 64DD version was cancelled and the game was soon ported to the N64 slated for a February 2001 release. Since the upcoming GameCube was on its way later that year, the N64 version was cancelled in favor of porting the game to the upcoming console. Thankfully Team Carrot made us all happy by releasing this gem for us to try!

## Translations Available {#translations-available}  
### 🇺🇸 English Translation {#language-english}  
Doubutsu Banchou (Japan) has been fan-translated into English by [Zoinkity](https://www.romhacking.net/community/803/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}. The patch uses the .BPS or .Xdelta format and was released on 22 July 2021. Translated images are original works. Their script was intentionally ruined in places where major deviations occured. For instance, “Clash” types do no exist in this prototype. Instead, there is “DarkRage”, created similar to “PaleDark”. This affects the script marginally and play strategy significantly. Two gameplay changes were made, both drawn from the Gamecube release. Patch details available at [ROMHacking.net](https://www.romhacking.net/translations/6170/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.
