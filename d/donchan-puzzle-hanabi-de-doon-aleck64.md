## 🕹️ Game Description
Donchan Puzzle is certainly a strange one. The goal of this game is to match coloured bombs, create combos, and send enough junk over to your opponent to fill their screen. The pieces are not just given to you though; they're determined by your slot machine. 3 buttons are each used to control one reel of the slot machine and once you've stopped them all you'll have your piece.

Your Slot machine can land on coloured bombs, character tiles which clear everything of that colour, balls of paper which are just garbage, or just on nothing at all. If your slot machine lands on 3 of the same character tiles then you'll be given a chance to send a massive amount of junk to your opponent. When this happens a timer will appear and your goal is to just do as many spins of your slot machine as possible as everything you land on before time runs out will be sent over to your opponent.

Although this game sounds weird it's not too hard to pick up on. The voice samples in this game are all Japanese and the text is 99% Japanese as well. Setting up a game is not hard but changing any settings may take some trial and error. This game supports 2 players so bring a friend to join in on the madness.
