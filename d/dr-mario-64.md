## 🕹️ Game Description
The flu season has come about, and it's Dr. Mario's duty to use his Megavitamins to heal the people of the land. However, Wario, wanting to have the fame that Dr. Mario has, attempts to steal the Megavitamins, but to no avail. Afterwards, Mad Scienstein and Rudy the Clown (from Wario Land 3) steal the Megavitamins, and both Dr. Mario and Wario give chase.

This game was also available from The **Nintendo Gateway System** specialised for airlines and hotels. As part of a partnership between Nintendo and LodgeNet from late 1993 up until the late 2000s, about 40,000 airline seats and 955,000 hotel rooms featured a modified version of the game. LodgeNet partnered with Nintendo to bring video games directly into guest hotel rooms through streaming over the LodgeNet server, with the special LodgeNet controller plugging directly into the television or LodgeNet set-top box, transmitting the game over phone lines connected to a central game server. Pricing was usually $6.95 plus tax for 1 hour of video games. After 1 hour, the game would immediately stop and prompt the user to purchase more play time. Many games were modified for single-player play only.

## Translations Available {#translations-available}  
### 🇯🇵 Japanese Translation {#language-japanese}  
*Dr. Mario 64* has been fan-translated into Portuguese by [Zoinkity](https://www.romhacking.net/community/803/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}. The patch uses the `.xdelta` format and was released on 25 February 2018. This patch de-localizes the USA release using the GC rebuild as reference in the hopes of approximating what the Japanese release would have been. If it was in English in GC, it is here too. If it wasn’t, it’s in Japanese. Patch details available at [ROMHacking.net](https://www.romhacking.net/translations/3459/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.
