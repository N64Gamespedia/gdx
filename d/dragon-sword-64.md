## 🕹️ Game Description
Dragon Sword 64 is an Action game, developed by Team Storm, which was cancelled before it was released. The game was cancelled during development and it is unknown as whether it was ever ever finished. Apparently, playing through the game, gamers have only been able to get to the end of Level 7 before the game crashes. Yet, in the game's coding, two more levels are mentioned, albeit without any storyline. Setting out to locate these extra levels was my primary motivation for having a look at this game a little more closely.
