## 🕹️ Game Description
In this one-on-one fighting game, the player can take any of the eight playable participants through the tournament mode. Once the selected hero has defeated his opponents, he will have to face battles against Sonork and Demitron. A practice mode is also available. During the fights the player can use standard attacks common for all the characters - vertical and horizontal punches, kicks, running jumps, etc. Each character also possesses an arsenal of special techniques, which can be executed by pressing different buttons in rapid succession.
