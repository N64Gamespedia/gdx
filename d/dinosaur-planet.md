## 🕹️ Game Description
Dinosaur Planet was a game originally developed by Rare and set to be published by Nintendo, planned for release on the Nintendo 64, but later intended for the Nintendo GameCube instead.

Originally, the game had nothing to do with the Star Fox series and was intended to be a stand-alone title. According to an interview with Shigeru Miyamoto, he had noticed the striking similarities between the game's characters and those of Star Fox, and so the decision was made for the game to become part of Star Fox as a launch title for the Nintendo GameCube. Although Rare scrapped the project due to Nintendo wanting it to be a Star Fox title on the GameCube, there is still a lot of leftovers from the game's development, which led to the game evolving into what became "Star Fox Adventures". The prototype of the game was published by Forest of Illusion on February 20th, 2021, who had purchased a CD from a private Swedish collector containing the late prototype.

The game is very much an early prototype and has many issues when trying to play it. Although work was underway to reverse engineer it to correct unfinished issues, it is still a very long way off from being fully playable. But very cool still none the less!

There is an amazing community for this game and is ever evolving with updates fixing various issues and stumbling blocks. You can find out more it over at [Dinosaur Planet Wiki](https://dinosaurpla.net/Main/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.
