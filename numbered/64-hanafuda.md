## üïπÔ∏è Game Description
<b>
_**64 Hanafuda: Tenshi no Yakusoku**_ is a traditional Japanese card game simulation developed and published by [Altron](https://gamicus.gamepedia.com/Altron){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} exclusively for the Nintendo 64 in Japan. Released in late 1999, the title recreates the classic Hanafuda deck experience, focusing on solo play.

Hanafuda, which translates to ‚Äúflower cards,‚Äù is used in various games like Koi-Koi and Hachi-Hachi, and has deep historical ties to Japanese gaming culture. While minimalist in presentation, *Tenshi no Yakusoku* serves as a niche gem for fans of strategic card play and traditional aesthetics on a modern console.
