Players choose from five snowboarders in third-person view, combining buttons to jump and pull off tricks across eight courses.

It was also available via the **Nintendo Gateway System**, a LodgeNet partnership that brought N64 games to airline seats and hotel TVs.

Pricing was around $6.95/hour, and gameplay was modified for single-player use only.
