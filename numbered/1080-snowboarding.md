## üïπÔ∏è Game Description  
<em><strong>1080¬∞ Snowboarding</strong></em> is a snowboard racing game developed by [Nintendo EAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_Analysis_and_Development){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} and published by [Nintendo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}. It was released on the Nintendo 64 in 1998. Players control one of five snowboarders from a third-person perspective, using a combination of buttons to jump and perform tricks over eight levels.

This game was also available through the **Nintendo Gateway System**, customized for airlines and hotel rooms via LodgeNet. The modified build streamed gameplay over phone lines through a LodgeNet controller connected to the hotel TV. Sessions were limited to 1-player and timed for hourly payment. This partnership brought Nintendo 64 gameplay to thousands of rooms across North America from the late 1990s through early 2000s.
