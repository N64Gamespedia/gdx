## 🕹️ Game Description
<b>
_**1080° Snowboarding**_ is a high-speed snowboarding simulation developed by Nintendo EAD, praised for its realistic physics, responsive controls, and challenging trick system. Players choose from a roster of snowboarders and boards, each with unique stats, and race down six mountain courses while performing aerial stunts and navigating treacherous terrain.

The game features multiple modes including Match Race, Time Attack, Trick Attack, Contest, and 2P VS. Its namesake trick — the 1080° spin — is notoriously difficult to land, requiring precise timing and input combinations. With dynamic weather effects, authentic sound design, and a steep learning curve, *1080° Snowboarding* remains one of the most technically impressive sports titles on the N64.
