## 🕹️ Game Description
<b>
_**64 Ōzumō 2**_ (_64大相撲2_, lit. “64 Professional Sumo Wrestling 2”) is the direct sequel to 1997’s *64 Ōzumō*, continuing its simulation-based approach to Japan’s national sport. Released exclusively in Japan, the game expands on sumo mechanics with more refined gameplay, updated visuals, and enhanced training modules.

Players manage the life of a sumo wrestler, including physical conditioning, match participation, and progression through the ranks. Much like its predecessor, the game is entirely in Japanese, making it a culturally rich but niche entry in the N64 library for international fans.
