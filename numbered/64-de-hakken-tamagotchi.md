## üïπÔ∏è Game Description
<b>
_**64 de Hakken! Tamagotchi: Minna de Tamagotchi World**_ is a Japan-exclusive Nintendo 64 title that blends virtual pet mechanics with party-style board gameplay, reminiscent of **Mario Party**. Developed by Hudson Soft and published by Bandai, it was the first Tamagotchi-branded game on the N64.

Players guide Tamagotchi characters across a virtual board, managing their care while engaging in competitive minigames. Each turn offers opportunities to feed, train, and nurture your Tamagotchi, with the winning player‚Äôs creature evolving into one of **59 unique characters** exclusive to this game. The game supports up to four players and features colorful visuals, quirky animations, and a variety of board events.

Its structure and charm make it a spiritual predecessor to **Tamagotchi: Party On!**, and a nostalgic gem in Bandai‚Äôs lineup.
