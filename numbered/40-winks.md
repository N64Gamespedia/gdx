## üïπÔ∏è Game Description
<b>
_**40 Winks**_ is a platform adventure where players control Ruff or Tumble ‚Äî siblings battling nightmare creatures while asleep. Developed by [Eurocom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurocom){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} and published by [Piko Interactive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piko_Interactive){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, it was originally canceled for the Nintendo 64 but later scene-released and revived via aftermarket distribution.

The goal is to free 40 "Winks" ‚Äî tiny white dream-makers held hostage by Nitekap and his minion Threadbear. Players collect moon tokens (used to scream at apparitions), Z tokens (prevent waking up), and floating cogs (unlock doors). Each world contains three levels, and gathering dream keys unlocks the clock-face portal to boss challenges.

Despite its rocky release history, *40 Winks* gained retro admiration as one of the few N64 titles rescued from cancellation.
