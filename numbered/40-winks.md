## 🛏️ Game Description
<b>
Originally developed for PlayStation and later ported to Nintendo 64, _**40 Winks**_ is a whimsical platformer where players control Ruff and Tumble — two siblings who must rescue dream creatures called “Winks” from the villainous Nitekap.

The game features dream-themed worlds, transformations into different characters (like a ninja or robot), and classic 3D platforming mechanics. Though the N64 version was cancelled in 1999, it was resurrected and released in 2018 thanks to Piko Interactive.
