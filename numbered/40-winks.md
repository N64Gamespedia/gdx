## 🕹️ Game Description

_**40 Winks**_ is a whimsical 3D platformer starring siblings **Ruff and Tumble**, who dive into dream realms to rescue creatures called *Winks* from the villainous *Nitekap* and his stuffed sidekick, *Threadbear*. Players traverse six themed worlds — Nightmare, Pirate, Space, Castle, Underwater, and Prehistoric — unlocking transformations into Ninja, Robot, Monster, and Superhero via Jack-in-the-Box power-ups.

The adventure blends light combat, puzzle solving, and collectible hunting, as you gather Z tokens (to stay asleep), moon tokens (used to scream at enemies), dream keys (to unlock boss challenges), and mechanical cogs (to open passages). Despite its original cancellation on N64, the game was resurrected by Piko Interactive for retro fans and cartridge collectors.
