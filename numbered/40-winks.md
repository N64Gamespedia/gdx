## üïπÔ∏è Game Description  
<em><strong>40 Winks</strong></em> is a platform game developed by [Eurocom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurocom){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} and published by [Piko Interactive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piko_Interactive){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} for the Nintendo 64. Although it was unreleased due to cancellation, on January 28, 2008 it saw a Scene Release by gorgyrip.

The player takes control of either Ruff or Tumble, a brother and sister who are sleeping and trying to free 40 "Winks" from a man named Nitekap and his accomplice, Threadbear. "Winks" are small, white creatures which make dreams, and "Hoodwinks", which are green and of a similar size, are responsible for nightmares. Throughout the game, the player can collect moon-shaped tokens to scream at dreamy apparitions, Z-shaped tokens to prevent waking up, and floating cogs to open doors. In each of the three levels per world, players collect four dream keys to place on the clock face, challenge the boss, and advance.
