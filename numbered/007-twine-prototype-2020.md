## üïπÔ∏è Prototype Description

_**The World Is Not Enough (U) ‚Äî Prototype 2020**_ is an early development build of the Nintendo 64 first-person shooter based on the 1999 James Bond film. Developed by [Eurocom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurocom){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} and published by [Electronic Arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Arts){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, this unfinished prototype was **scene released** on September 22, 2020.

Compared to the final version from 2000, this build is significantly incomplete, buggy, and visually different ‚Äî missing assets, broken functions, and altered gameplay. It's a fascinating behind-the-scenes look into late-stage N64 development.
