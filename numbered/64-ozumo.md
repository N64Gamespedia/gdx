## 🕹️ Game Description
<b>
_**64 Ōzumō**_ (_64大相撲_, lit. “64 Professional Sumo Wrestling”) is a Japan-exclusive simulation of sumo wrestling released in 1997 for the Nintendo 64. Developed and published by Bottom Up, the game immerses players in the culture and sport of Japanese sumo through stylized visuals and rich simulation elements.

Unlike arcade-style wrestling games, this one features in-depth mechanics like wrestler training, dietary routines, and career progression. With all in-game text in Japanese, it offers an authentic experience but poses a challenge to non-Japanese speakers. Despite its niche appeal, it remains a curious entry for collectors and fans of traditional sports sims.
