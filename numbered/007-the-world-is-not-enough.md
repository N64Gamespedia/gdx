## üïπÔ∏è Game Description
<b>
_**007: The World Is Not Enough**_ is a cinematic first-person shooter based on the 1999 James Bond film. Players assume the role of Agent 007 across 14 missions, featuring stealth, gadgets, and high-stakes combat. Developed by [Eurocom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurocom){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, the game includes a split-screen multiplayer mode and supports the Expansion Pak for enhanced visuals. Missions range from hostage rescues to underwater sabotage, with gadgets like the Keypad Decrypter and wristwatch laser adding spy flair.

Praised for its smooth frame rate and level design, the game was considered a worthy successor to *GoldenEye 007*, though its AI and pacing drew mixed reviews.
