## üïπÔ∏è Game Description
<b>
_**007: The World Is Not Enough**_ is a first-person shooter based on the 1999 James Bond film of the same name. Developed by Eurocom and published by Electronic Arts, the game puts players in the role of Agent 007 through story-driven missions filled with espionage, gadgets, and fast-paced combat.

With multiple weapons, stealth segments, and cinematic set pieces, the game aims to capture the style of Bond while offering variety in gameplay. Unlike its PlayStation counterpart, the N64 version runs on a modified version of the Quake II engine, allowing for smoother graphics and multiplayer deathmatch options.
