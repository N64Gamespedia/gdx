## üïπÔ∏è Game Description
Frogger 2: Swampy's Revenge is a video game released in 2000 for various platforms. Interactive Studios began development on Frogger 2 for the N64, set to be released with the other versions of the game. Unfortunately, it was cancelled and the console was left without its needed dose of amphibian vehicle-dodging action. The game is part of the Frogger series, and the sequel to the 1997 remake of Frogger, featuring similar 4-way movement gameplay in a 3D world. Unlike its predecessor, Frogger 2 featured a choice of different characters to play with in the game, several multiplayer modes, and an in-game storyline. A huge thanks to CARROT for making this possible to play and enjoy!
