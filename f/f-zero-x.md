This game was also available from The <strong>Nintendo Gateway System</strong> specialised for airlines and hotels. As part of a partnership between Nintendo and LodgeNet from late 1993 up until the late 2000s, about 40,000 airline seats and 955,000 hotel rooms featured a modified version of the game. LodgeNet partnered with Nintendo to bring video games directly into guest hotel rooms through streaming over the LodgeNet server, with the special LodgeNet controller plugging directly into the television or LodgeNet set-top box, transmitting the game over phone lines connected to a central game server. Pricing was usually $6.95 plus tax for 1 hour of video games. After 1 hour, the game would immediately stop and prompt the user to purchase more play time. Many games were modified for single-player play only.

The patch uses the `.xdelta` format and was released on 12 November 2023. The game is translated and edited in Brazilian Portuguese. With all texts translated (Unaccented), all possible textures were edited. We also need to edit the names in 3D, Finish and Gameover. In the future, a possible update will be completed. Other than that, the game is working perfectly. Patch details available at [ROMHacking.net](https://www.romhacking.net/translations/7102/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.
