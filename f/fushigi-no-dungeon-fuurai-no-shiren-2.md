## 🕹️ Game Description
Fushigi no Dungeon: Fuurai no Shiren 2 - Oni Shuurai! Shiren Jou! is a role-playing video game developed and published by Chunsoft for the Nintendo 64. It is the second main entry in the Shiren the Wanderer series, which is part of the larger Mystery Dungeon series, and was originally released in Japan on September 27, 2000. The game follows Shiren, a boy who aims to defend a village from attacking demons by building a castle; he finds building materials and other items by exploring dungeons. The game was the first in the series to use 3D graphics, which was done as a way to evolve the series; the development team focused on creating original features, and used the 3D engine to enable free roaming through open environments. It was originally planned for release on the 64DD, but development was later moved to the regular Nintendo 64 instead
