## 🕹️ Game Description
Flying Dragon (Hiryū no Ken Twin) in Japan, is a side-view battle game reminiscent of 16-bit titles. It features eight characters to choose from with two main modes of play, "SD" (super deformed) and "Virtual" (ala 'Virtua Fighter' style). SD mode is sort of RPG'ish with treasures you gain from winning battles and becoming a stronger fighter. it has the usual circuit, tournament and practice modes plus a 'treasure box' where you check your existing items, buy new items or trade items you already have for something else. Virtual mode is the more familiar format of a battle game with game modes such as circuit, tournament and practice. It also has 2D and 3D "rules" for how the game is played. 2D is 16-bit arcade style and 3D is more realistic.
