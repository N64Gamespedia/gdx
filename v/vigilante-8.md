## 🕹️ Game Description  
*Vigilante 8* is a vehicular combat game similar to *Twisted Metal* in concept. Players choose from eight characters with different agendas and select vehicles ranging from classic 1970s muscle cars to a school bus, each stacked high with various kinds of weapons. Unlockables include two hidden levels (three in the Nintendo 64 version) and five hidden characters and cars. Multiplayer is also included: the Nintendo 64 version allows four players to go head-to-head.

The game takes place in the Western United States during a time of worldwide oil shortage in 1976. An organization known as OMAR (Oil Monopoly Alliance Regime) was making money off the shortage everywhere except in the United States. OMAR hires the best terrorist that $100 million could buy: Sid Burn. His job, aided by five hired Coyotes, is to destroy all gas refineries in the southwest of the U.S. so OMAR can bring the country to its knees. When gas prices go wild, six civilians who call themselves Vigilantes — led by the truck driver Convoy — begin fighting against the Coyotes in different areas to keep OMAR from succeeding.
