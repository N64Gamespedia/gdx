## 🕹️ Game Description  
*Vivid Dolls* is one of those games that could only have come from Japan. You control a small ball and must draw pieces of a picture of a partially naked woman while avoiding enemies. You begin with one small piece already revealed and must uncover 70% or more of the image to advance to the next stage.

There are 8 girls to choose from, each with 3 stages. Power-ups can be found that increase your speed or slow down enemies. The game supports two-player mode. All in-game text is in English, so no Japanese knowledge is required to play.

As expected, this game is **not safe for work**. The content is explicit, and viewing gameplay on YouTube requires sign-in due to [age restrictions](https://www.youtube.com/t/community_guidelines){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.
