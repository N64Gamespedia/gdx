## 🕹️ Game Description  
*Viewpoint 2064* was a 3D vertical shoot-em-up being developed by Racdym to be published by the series owners Sammy Corporation. It was a sequel to the original *Viewpoint* which released in 1992. *Viewpoint 2064*’s first known announcement was in August 1999, when Nintendo announced their Space World August 1999 lineup. The game was playable at both Space World and the September 1999 Tokyo Game Show. In Nintendo’s Space World guide book, it was given a half-page advertisement and was listed as 100% complete, set for a November 11th, 1999 release date — but *Viewpoint 2064* did not hit this date, and by 2001 the game had been quietly cancelled.

Out of all the versions of *Viewpoint* that were released, *Viewpoint 2064* was the only one developed as a true sequel, with entirely different levels, mechanics, graphics, progression, and story. No official reason for cancellation was given. Thankfully, the prototype was Scene Released in 2020 by togemet2 — thank you, togemet2!
