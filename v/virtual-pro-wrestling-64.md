## 🕹️ Game Description  
*Virtual Pro Wrestling 64* is a professional wrestling video game released in 1997 on the Nintendo 64 and the second game in the *Virtual Pro Wrestling* series. It is a sequel to the original *Virtual Pro Wrestling* released in 1996 exclusively for the PlayStation. This entry was only released in Japan and serves as the Japanese counterpart to *WCW vs nWo: World Tour*. The game features wrestlers from World Championship Wrestling, along with generic renditions of wrestlers from major Japanese promotions such as New Japan Pro Wrestling and All Japan Pro Wrestling — a feature that would continue in the sequel *Virtual Pro Wrestling 2*.
