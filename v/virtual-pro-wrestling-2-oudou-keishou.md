## 🕹️ Game Description  
The sequel to *Virtual Pro Wrestling 64*, released only in Japan. The title translates to “Royal Road Succession,” the name of the career mode in the game. This was the fifth wrestling game developed by AKI Corporation and introduced many improvements that would later appear in AKI’s final Nintendo 64 wrestling title, *WWF No Mercy*. However, some features — such as mask creation in edit mode and the MMA-style grappling system — were unique to *Virtual Pro Wrestling 2* and not carried forward.

The game carries the All Japan Pro Wrestling license and features 21 wrestlers from their promotion. The remaining characters are based on real wrestlers from other Japanese promotions, but due to copyright restrictions, they appear under fake names and altered appearances — a common practice in Japanese wrestling games. Their identities can be inferred through unique moves, taunts, and attire options in edit mode.

In total, the game includes 98 wrestlers, 23 of which must be unlocked. Additionally, there are 16 original character slots for custom creations, bringing the potential roster to 114 — the largest of any AKI wrestling game. For comparison, *WWF No Mercy* features 64 wrestlers.
