## 🕹️ Game Description
Forget power-ups — *South Park Rally* replaces banana peels with weird weapons, filthy quotes, and outrageous stage hazards. This kart-style racer throws Kyle, Kenny, Stan, Cartman, and more into chaotic circuits around the show’s town — school, police station, volcano, and beyond — with transforming terrain, shifting objectives, and no brakes on the vulgarity. You race not just to place first, but to hit checkpoints, collect items, and avoid oncoming cows or barf puddles. Pickups include Mexican staring frogs, voodoo dolls, and Mr. Hankey himself. Multiplayer supports up to four players and includes Deathmatch variants, character unlocks, and layered insults direct from the cast. If *Mario Kart* had a delinquent cousin with zero supervision — this would be it.
