Based on the *X-wing Rogue Squadron* comic series, this intense aerial combat simulator lets you take command of Luke Skywalker and the elite Rogue Squadron during the gap between *A New Hope* and *The Empire Strikes Back*. You‚Äôll soar through 16 high-stakes missions across iconic battlefields, piloting X-wings, A-wings, Y-wings, and Snowspeeders. Unlock medals, bonus ships, and upgrades while enjoying sharp visuals powered by the Expansion Pak. The Japanese release, retitled *Shutsugeki! Rogue Chuutai*, delivers the full Rebel flight experience in localized form.

## Gateway System  
This game was also available from the **Nintendo Gateway System**, specialised for airlines and hotels. As part of a partnership between Nintendo and LodgeNet from late 1993 up until the late 2000s, about 40,000 airline seats and 955,000 hotel rooms featured a modified version of the game. LodgeNet partnered with Nintendo to bring video games directly into guest hotel rooms through streaming over the LodgeNet server, with the special LodgeNet controller plugging directly into the television or LodgeNet set-top box, transmitting the game over phone lines connected to a central game server. Pricing was usually $6.95 plus tax for 1 hour of video games. After 1 hour, the game would immediately stop and prompt the user to purchase more play time. Many games were modified for single-player play only.
