## Game Description  
Mario arrives at Peach’s Castle only to discover she’s been kidnapped by Bowser once again. The villain has trapped her subjects and cursed the castle using powerful magic. Mario must collect Power Stars scattered across vast 3D worlds to unlock new areas, defeat Bowser’s minions, and rescue the Princess. With innovative platform mechanics, expansive levels, and a range of acrobatic moves — including triple jumps, wall kicks, and backflips — *Super Mario 64* redefined 3D gaming. Power-ups like the Wing Cap, Metal Cap, and Vanish Cap grant new abilities, while cannons and flying unlock unreachable zones. The Shindou Edition includes Rumble Pak support and updated voice clips.

## Gateway System  
This game was also available from The **Nintendo Gateway System** specialised for airlines and hotels. As part of a partnership between Nintendo and LodgeNet from late 1993 up until the late 2000s, about 40,000 airline seats and 955,000 hotel rooms featured a modified version of the game. LodgeNet partnered with Nintendo to bring video games directly into guest hotel rooms through streaming over the LodgeNet server, with the special LodgeNet controller plugging directly into the television or LodgeNet set-top box, transmitting the game over phone lines connected to a central game server. Pricing was usually $6.95 plus tax for 1 hour of video games. After 1 hour, the game would immediately stop and prompt the user to purchase more play time. Many games were modified for single-player play only.
