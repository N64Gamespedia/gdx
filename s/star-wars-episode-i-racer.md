## Game Description  
Inspired by the iconic podracing sequence from *Star Wars Episode I – The Phantom Menace*, this title puts players behind the controls of gravity-defying speed machines across treacherous galactic terrain. Choose Anakin Skywalker or other alien racers and navigate twisting canyons, icy tunnels, and volcanic mines in over two dozen tracks. Each podracer offers upgradeable parts powered by race earnings — from cooling systems to acceleration thrusters. The thrill of tight turns and explosive collisions is amplified by authentic Star Wars sound effects, Rumble Pak support, and a cockpit view that channels raw velocity. It’s not just a race — it’s survival at 600mph.
