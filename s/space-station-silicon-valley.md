## 🕹️ Game Description  
Built over a thousand years ago, Space Station Silicon Valley mysteriously vanished shortly after launch — now it's back and on a collision course with Earth. You play as Evo, a robotic microchip that can jump into the bodies of robotic animals across themed environments. Each possessed creature gives you new abilities, from wall-climbing rats to flying sheep. Solve environmental puzzles, complete absurd missions, and discover bizarre lore with evolving gameplay at every level. Behind its oddball charm lies groundbreaking physics, offbeat humor, and some of the cleverest level design of the N64 era.
