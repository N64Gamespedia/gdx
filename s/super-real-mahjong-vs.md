## Game Description  
*Super Real Mahjong VS* is an adult-oriented mahjong arcade game developed by SETA and released in 1999 for the Japan-exclusive Aleck64 platform. Featuring animated cutscenes and progression-based unlocks, the game blends standard mahjong strategy with risqu√© visual storytelling. Explicit themes are central to gameplay presentation, and access to gameplay footage is often gated by age restrictions on video platforms. This entry marks one of SETA's final Aleck64 releases before the platform was sunset.
