## 🕹️ Game Description  
In his first 3D adventure, Spider-Man swings onto the N64 to chase a mysterious imposter who’s framed him for theft — and unleashed chaos across New York City. Based loosely on *Spider-Man: The Animated Series* and *Spider-Man Unlimited*, this title includes voice actors and character designs from both. You’ll web-sling between skyscrapers, crawl across ceilings, and punch through thugs in tight corridors, navigating a story that features cameos from Black Cat, Venom, Mysterio, and more. With stealth missions, explosive boss fights, and collectible costumes that unlock new powers, it’s classic Spidey delivered with comic-book flair and late-era N64 polish.
