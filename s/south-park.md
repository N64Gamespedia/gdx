## 🕹️ Game Description
A comet is streaking toward South Park, triggering chaos and resurrecting bizarre enemies from the show’s earliest seasons — mutant cows, alien invaders, and insane clones. Take control of Kyle, Cartman, Stan, and Kenny in a profanity-laced first-person battle across 15 stages. Story Mode unfolds like episodes, with linear levels leading to boss battles that demand quick wits and quirky weapons: snowballs, cow launchers, and even Terrance and Phillip dolls. Each weapon activates different kid characters and alternate fire modes. Health depletion triggers escalating bleeps and dialogue meltdowns. Multiplayer supports up to four players in deathmatch arenas with voice lines, taunts, and game-unlock bonuses from the campaign. It's foul, fast, and unapologetically South Park.
