## 🕹️ Game Description
<em><strong>SimCity 2000</strong></em> for the Nintendo 64 was released exclusively in Japan and offers a unique twist on the beloved city-building formula. Beyond standard zoning, budgeting, and infrastructure management, this variant introduces quirky 3D mini-games including monster breeding, horse racing, and even a dating simulation. Disasters range from earthquakes to kaiju-style monster attacks, and players can deploy their trained creature to battle incoming threats. With stylized city views, animated TV updates in place of newspapers, and immersive visual tweaks, this Japan-only version adds bold flavor to classic simulation gameplay.
