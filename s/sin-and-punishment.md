## 🕹️ Game Description  
<em><strong>In a resource-starved future Earth</strong></em>, mutants called Lufians—originally engineered to solve the food crisis—rebel against humanity, triggering devastation. With the military defeated, teenagers Saki Amamiya and Airan Jo shoulder the fate of civilization. Their journey unveils the Lufians’ deeper motives and sets the stage for a climactic battle against extinction. Treasure's rail shooter fuses frenetic gameplay, voice-acted cutscenes, and visceral set pieces, earning its legacy as one of the N64’s most iconic imports.

The PAL-CHN iQue release preserved the English title “Sin and Punishment” on box art and in-game UI while localizing menus and subtitles into Chinese. Japanese voice acting remained untouched. This dual-language setup is a classic soft localization—maintaining global branding while adapting accessibility for the target region.
