## üïπÔ∏è Game Description
<em><strong>San Francisco Rush 2049</strong></em> is the third entry in the Rush series, following San Francisco Rush and Rush 2: Extreme Racing USA. Set in a futuristic version of San Francisco, the game delivers high-speed arcade action, death-defying shortcuts, and airborne stunts via car-mounted wings. Players can compete across six race tracks, four stunt arenas, eight battle arenas, and a secret obstacle course called The Gauntlet. The game also includes a multiplayer mode for up to four players, Rumble Pak support, techno-inspired music, and an intense deathmatch mode for ultimate battle chaos.

This game was also available through the Nintendo Gateway System, a specialized platform for airlines and hotels. As part of a partnership between Nintendo and LodgeNet from late 1993 up until the late 2000s, about 40,000 airline seats and 955,000 hotel rooms featured a modified version of the game. LodgeNet partnered with Nintendo to bring video games directly into guest hotel rooms through streaming over the LodgeNet server, with the special LodgeNet controller plugging directly into the television or LodgeNet set-top box, transmitting the game over phone lines connected to a central game server. Pricing was usually $6.95 plus tax for 1 hour of video games. After 1 hour, the game would immediately stop and prompt the user to purchase more play time. Many games were modified for single-player play only.

This version however, was not found and converted for use on the N64 system
