## 🕹️ Game Description

*Big Mountain 2000*, known in Japan as *Snow Speeder* (スノースピーダー, *Sunō Supīdā*), is a skiing and snowboarding racing game for the Nintendo 64. *Big Mountain 2000* brings the snow shreddin' excitement to your room! Or, that's what I bet the back of the box says. Unlike *1080 Snowboarding*, BM2K is not prejudiced against skiiers. You'll be able to play as both snowboarders and skiiers in one of three modes: Championship, Time Attack, and Two Player. The game features 4 courses (one is unlockable) and six characters with brand name gear. BM2K is geared more towards racing and less towards tricks, although tricks are included and can help.
