## Game Description  
*Super B-Daman: Battle Phoenix 64* adapts the popular Japanese *B-Daman* manga and toy line, where marble-shooting humanoid figures clash in dynamic mini-games. Players take aim in fast-paced challenges like digital billiards and Whack-a-Mole variants, using a crosshair to nail targets. Up to four characters — each with distinct abilities like firing rate or power — compete across themed arenas in shootout battles and physics-based tournaments. Unlockables expand your roster as you climb through increasingly intense solo missions or battle in local multiplayer chaos. The gameplay hinges on reflex, strategy, and marble mastery.
