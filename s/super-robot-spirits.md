## Game Description  
*Super Robot Spirits* is a 3D one-on-one fighting game featuring iconic mecha from the *Super Robot Wars* franchise and classic anime. Players choose from seven protagonists ‚Äî including Voltes V, Dancougar, Daitarn 3, and the R-1 unit ‚Äî and battle through multiple modes such as Story, Guts Survival, Time Attack, and Training. Combat mixes standard strikes and special moves with flight mechanics, and each fighter has two energy bars: one for health and another for super attacks. Unlockable mecha expand the roster, including a debuting original unit exclusive to this title. Gameplay ties into a storyline involving a mysterious force threatening Earth, and the narrative adapts depending on the chosen character.
