## 🕹️ Game Description
Last Legion UX is an action game for the Nintendo 64. It was released only in Japan in 1999. The game plays similar to later PlayStation Armored Core games or Sega Virtual On. Players can choose from a variety of robot mechs. They can also choose their level of weaponry, and choose the level of shielding that may offer more protection than other types but will slow the mech down.
