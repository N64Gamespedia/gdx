## üïπÔ∏è Game Description  
Professor Oak needs your help! Hop into the ZERO-ONE vehicle and explore Pok√©mon Island‚Äôs diverse biomes to photograph elusive Pok√©mon. Use items like apples and Pester Balls to draw them out or trigger special reactions. Whether sneaking through caves or gliding past volcanoes, uncover rare poses to impress the Professor. This was the first Pok√©mon game rendered in full 3D, and it remains a uniquely peaceful, creative entry in the series canon. The Pok√©mon Snap Station was a special Nintendo 64 kiosk found at Blockbuster Video stores in the late 1990s.

This game was also available from The **Nintendo Gateway System** specialised for airlines and hotels. As part of a partnership between Nintendo and LodgeNet from late 1993 up until the late 2000s, about 40,000 airline seats and 955,000 hotel rooms featured a modified version of the game. LodgeNet partnered with Nintendo to bring video games directly into guest hotel rooms through streaming over the LodgeNet server, with the special LodgeNet controller plugging directly into the television or LodgeNet set-top box, transmitting the game over phone lines connected to a central game server. Pricing was usually $6.95 plus tax for 1 hour of video games. After 1 hour, the game would immediately stop and prompt the user to purchase more play time. Many games were modified for single-player play only.
