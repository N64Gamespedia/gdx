## 🕹️ Game Description  
The third main installment in the *Puyo Puyo* series, *Puyo Puyo Sun* takes a retro-fueled leap by returning to the original game's aesthetic while introducing new mechanics. The name “Sun” is a Japanese pun—referencing both the tropical setting and the Japanese word “san” (三), meaning three. This entry adds Sun Puyo blocks to the mix, creating opportunities for powerful chain reactions. Released exclusively in Japan, it refines the competitive tile-matching gameplay with new features and anime-styled charm that pushed the series deeper into cult icon status.
