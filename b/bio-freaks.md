## üïπÔ∏è Game Description

*Bio F.R.E.A.K.S.* is a 3D fighting video game released by [Midway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midway_Games){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} in 1998 for the Nintendo 64.  
Set in the not-too-distant future, technology and bio-engineering accelerated at such an incredible rate, and forced an industrial competition of corporate espionage. The government tried to keep control of the country by a single thread, but the effect of the giant corporations' white collar wars drove the economy into a tailspin. Neo-Amerika rises as the result of the government bankruptcy and technological company takeover. To maintain order, The Secret Games Commission (SGC) is formed to organize tournaments deciding which organization gets to control all of Neo-Amerika, leading to the creation of Biological Flying Robotic Enhanced Armored Killing Synthoids (Bio F.R.E.A.K.S.) serving as the champions for each participating organization.
