## 🕹️ Game Description
<em><strong>BattleTanx</strong></em> is a 1998 action game released for the Nintendo 64, produced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_3DO_Company" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The 3DO Company</a>. It is an action game where players control colorful tanks to blow buildings and each other up. Multiplayer is the game's big drawing point, featuring standard deathmatch and capture the flag modes.

The story of the single player campaign revolves around a world where there are only a few women on the planet left after a disease wipes most of them out. Thus, our hero hops into one of three tanks to save them from crude post-apocalyptic gangs that have taken them.
