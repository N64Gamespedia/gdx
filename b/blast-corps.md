## Game Description

*Blast Corps* is a 1997 action game, developed by [Rare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_(company)) and published by [Nintendo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo) for the Nintendo 64, in which the player uses vehicles to destroy buildings in the path of a runaway nuclear missile carrier. In the game's 57 levels, the player solves puzzles by transferring between vehicles to move objects and bridge gaps. It was released in March 1997 in Japan and North America, and then a wider release for Europe followed at the end of that year.
