## 🕹️ Game Description
<em><strong>Banjo-Tooie</strong></em> is a platform video game developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_(company)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rare</a> and originally released for the Nintendo 64 console in 2000. It is the second game in the <em>Banjo-Kazooie</em> series and the sequel to <em>Banjo-Kazooie</em>. The game follows series protagonists Banjo and Kazooie as they attempt to stop the plans of the witch Gruntilda and her two sisters, who intend to vaporize the inhabitants of the game's world. The game features worlds that are significantly larger than those of its predecessor, requiring the player to complete challenges such as solving puzzles, jumping over obstacles, collecting items, and defeating bosses. It also includes a multiplayer mode where up to four players can compete in several minigames.
