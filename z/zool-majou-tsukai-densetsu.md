## 🕹️ Game Description  
Zool: Majou Tsukai Densetsu (ズール 魔獣使い伝説) is a role-playing video game for the Nintendo 64. It was released in 1999 in Japan only. The gameplay is similar to Pokémon in that it shares the same concept of catching monsters. Your character finds a monster and raises it to battle evil. The towns are presented in a top-down view. The houses, inns, bars, dungeons, and shops are fixed points you can put a cursor over. The battle system features a bar of musical notes that the player uses to command the monsters. You can carry up to four monsters at a time.
