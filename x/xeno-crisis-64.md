## 🕹️ Game Description  
*Xeno Crisis* is an arena shooter in which one or two players take control of battle-hardened marines embarking on a deadly mission to confront an alien menace and get home alive. Run and gun your way through thousands of adversaries as you explore the devastated research outpost, searching for survivors, and ultimately facing the origin of the outpost's demise.

Outpost 88 is divided into seven distinct areas, each randomly generated with every playthrough, requiring adaptive strategy. Collect dog-tags from vanquished enemies to upgrade your equipment between areas and look out for special weapons that offer temporary advantages.

- Faithful port of the hit 16-bit game with added extras  
- Pixel art by Henk Nieborg  
- FM chiptune soundtrack by Savaged Regime  
- Two difficulty levels and three modes of play  
- Arsenal of 10 weapons  
- Solo or local co-op play
