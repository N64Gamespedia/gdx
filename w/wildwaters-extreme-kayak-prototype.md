## 🕹️ Game Description
<em><strong>WildWaters</strong></em> (also known as “Extreme Kayak” and “X-Stream”) was a canceled water-based racing title in development by Looking Glass Studios around 1998–1999 for the Nintendo 64. Announced at E3 1999 with Ubisoft interested as the publisher, the game showcased real-time water physics rendered on N64 hardware — a technological feat. Five gameplay modes were planned: Arcade, Time Trial, Championship, Finals, and Versus Battle. Despite its innovation, the game was never completed due to the studio’s financial collapse in May 2000. The project vanished alongside fellow N64 prototype *Mini Racers*. Not to be confused with *Wild Water World Championships* by Promethean Designs.
