## 🕹️ Game Description
<em><strong>Wave Race 64</strong></em> is a jet-ski racing game. The goal is to beat the other participants in the race by successfully navigating the jet-ski through courses marked by colored buoys. Red and yellow buoys must be passed on the right and left side, respectively, in order to gain speed and ensure advantage in the race. Failure to pass the buoys leads to speed loss and potential disqualification. Game modes include Warm-Up (training in Dolphin Park), Time Trials, Championship (multi-tier tournament), and Stunt Mode (point-based trick showcase). A two-player Versus mode is also available. Players can customize racer stats including grip, handling, acceleration, top speed, and collision stability.

This game was also available from The **Nintendo Gateway System** specialised for airlines and hotels. As part of a partnership between Nintendo and LodgeNet from late 1993 up until the late 2000s, about 40,000 airline seats and 955,000 hotel rooms featured a modified version of the game. LodgeNet partnered with Nintendo to bring video games directly into guest hotel rooms through streaming over the LodgeNet server, with the special LodgeNet controller plugging directly into the television or LodgeNet set-top box, transmitting the game over phone lines connected to a central game server. Pricing was usually $6.95 plus tax for 1 hour of video games. After 1 hour, the game would immediately stop and prompt the user to purchase more play time. Many games were modified for single-player play only.
