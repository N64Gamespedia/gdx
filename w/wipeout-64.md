## 🕹️ Game Description
<em><strong>Wipeout 64</strong></em> is a futuristic anti-gravity racer developed by Psygnosis, published by Midway for the Nintendo 64. It builds on the legacy of the PlayStation *Wipeout* series, offering high-speed hovercraft racing with weapon-based combat. Players choose among several teams and ships, racing through twisting tracks filled with speed pads, barriers, and aggressive rivals. The N64 version added split-screen multiplayer for up to 4 players. A rare PAL prototype build leaked in 2017 was documented by Zoinkity, now preserved via archive repositories and emulation.
