## 🕹️ Game Description
*Robotech: Crystal Dreams* was a space combat simulator developed by GameTek for the Nintendo 64, inspired by the Robotech anime universe. Although canceled before completion, a beta prototype was recovered and released by Hidden Palace. Players piloted transformable mecha across war zones, taking on mercenary missions that earned credits used for upgrades and base interactions. Between combat sorties, a dynamic galactic newsfeed revealed battlefront changes, allowing players to choose where to intervene for better rewards. Each Veritech fighter could shift between Fighter, Guardian, and Battloid modes, offering tactical flexibility and anime-style action.
