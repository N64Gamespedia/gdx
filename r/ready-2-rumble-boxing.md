## üïπÔ∏è Game Description
*Ready 2 Rumble Boxing* brings a cartoonish punch to the ring with 16 flamboyant fighters, over-the-top taunts, and full voice commentary by Michael Buffer himself. The game mixes arcade power moves and traditional boxing techniques, featuring low blows, lunging hooks, and buildable ‚ÄúRUMBLE‚Äù meters for cinematic attacks. Between Arcade, Championship, and Training modes, players can hone their punch timing or craft their ideal boxer. With combo-triggered knockouts and exaggerated animations, this is boxing at its loudest and most stylish.

<p id="Gateway-System">This game was also available from the Nintendo Gateway System specialised for airlines and hotels. As part of a partnership between Nintendo and LodgeNet from late 1993 up until the late 2000s, about 40,000 airline seats and 955,000 hotel rooms featured a modified version of the game. LodgeNet partnered with Nintendo to bring video games directly into guest hotel rooms through streaming over the LodgeNet server, with the special LodgeNet controller plugging directly into the television or LodgeNet set-top box, transmitting the game over phone lines connected to a central game server. Pricing was usually $6.95 plus tax for 1 hour of video games. After 1 hour, the game would immediately stop and prompt the user to purchase more play time. Many games were modified for single-player play only.</p>
