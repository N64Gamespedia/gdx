## 🕹️ Game Description
*Razor Freestyle Scooter* flips the extreme sports genre onto two tiny wheels, sending players into urban skate zones armed with high-flying tricks and rescue missions. Instead of simply scoring points, you’re up against a sky fortress run by a mechanical villain who’s captured your skate crew. Complete objectives across three large areas by collecting scooter wheels, unlocking bonus time, and mastering aerial combos to earn rescue attempts. Each success frees a new playable character — all while grinding rails, flipping kickspins, and dodging obstacles at breakneck speed.
