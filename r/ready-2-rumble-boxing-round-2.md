## 🕹️ Game Description
*Ready 2 Rumble Boxing: Round 2* returns with 17 fighters including Afro Thunder and four celebrity characters, each animated with exaggerated flair. Players train using mini-games like jump rope and speed bag to boost stats, then unleash cinematic knockouts in Arcade, Tournament, or Team Battle modes. Smarter AI and new rumble mechanics add depth to the chaos, while taunts, combos, and voice commentary keep the action loud and stylish. It’s a punch-packed sequel that dials up the personality and power.
