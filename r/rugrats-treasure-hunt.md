## 🕹️ Game Description
In their big debut on the Nintendo 64, the favorite cartoon babies are about to get wrapped up in the scavenger hunt to end all scavenger hunts. Featuring three different board games, *Rugrats: Scavenger Hunt* utilizes the animation and humor from the cartoon series, and melds it into an original game that has players traipsing through 3D worlds looking for hidden objects.

- In **The Pirate Treasure Hunt**, the babies travel underwater in search of items.  
- **Angelica's Temple of Gloom** challenges players to find bits of Stu's broken Aztec statues before Angelica can.  
- **Reptar Rally** has the babies collecting sweets in Candy Island.

Once you choose your baby from a list that includes Tommy, Chuckie, Phil, or Lil, you begin using a spinner (just like a board game spinner) to determine how many spaces you'll advance. There are lots of trick spaces that give you advantages or disadvantages, like the Spike the Dog spot (which allows you to ride the pet for five spaces), and a Dil spot (which makes Dil come out and shuffle the board). Don't get too worked up though, as each baby has an energy meter, and if it hits zero you'll have to take a nap.
