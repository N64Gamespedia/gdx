## 🕹️ Game Description
*Roadsters Trophy* gears up for street-savvy racing with 10 adrenaline-fueled tracks featuring dynamic weather and responsive car handling. Unlike typical racing games, players must bet cash and trade cars to advance through divisions and customize their vehicle lineup. From rain-soaked circuits to speedway sprints, Roadsters challenges players to outsmart opponents both on the road and in the garage. Four-player split-screen and high-speed progression give this title a gritty twist on traditional racing gameplay.
