## 🕹️ Game Description
*Road Rash 64* merges motorcycle racing with full-contact violence as players brawl through 200 miles of interlinked tracks using fists, chains, and the dreaded spoke jam. Choose from over 25 riders and bikes, each with different speed and handling profiles, and battle opponents in arcade modes like Deathmatch, Tag, and Cop Mode. AI rivals form grudges and alliances during races, reacting dynamically as you earn cash for upgrades and unlock new routes. With its thrashin’ licensed soundtrack (Sugar Ray, The Mermen) and split-screen multiplayer for four, Road Rash 64 cranks street racing into a bruising spectacle.
