## 🕹️ Game Description
Link's all-new epic adventure lands him in the mystical world of Termina, where ever-present clocks count down the hours until a menacing moon falls from the sky above. When his horse and Ocarina are stolen by a strange, masked figure, Link embarks on an urgent quest to solve the mystery of the moon, save the world from destruction, and find his way back to the peaceful land of Hyrule!  
* Link transforms before your eyes--Over 20 magical masks give Link powers and abilities he's never had before! Watch him transform into a hapless Deku child, a mighty Goron hero and a legendary Zora guitarist.  
* Race against time--Characters and events flow with the hours of the day. Set your own schedule and even alter time itself in a race to stop the moon and save the world!  
* Panoramic environments! Powered-up action battles! Fully interactive characters and events! Experience gorgeous rendered landscapes, swarms of attacking enemies and a deep, engrossing world of wonders with the power of the N64 Expansion Pak.

This game was also available from The **Nintendo Gateway System** specialised for airlines and hotels. As part of a partnership between Nintendo and LodgeNet from late 1993 up until the late 2000s, about 40,000 airline seats and 955,000 hotel rooms featured a modified version of the game. LodgeNet partnered with Nintendo to bring video games directly into guest hotel rooms through streaming over the LodgeNet server, with the special LodgeNet controller plugging directly into the television or LodgeNet set-top box, transmitting the game over phone lines connected to a central game server. Pricing was usually $6.95 plus tax for 1 hour of video games. After 1 hour, the game would immediately stop and prompt the user to purchase more play time. Many games were modified for single-player play only.
