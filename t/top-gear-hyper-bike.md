## 🕹️ Game Description
<em><strong>Top Gear Hyper Bike</strong></em> delivers high-speed motocross and street racing with licensed bikes from Kawasaki, Yamaha, and Honda. Players can compete in four modes — Single Race, Time Attack, Trick Attack, and Championship — while unlocking hidden bikes and bonus tracks. The game features a Track Editor for custom course creation, realistic physics, and segmented rider animations for dynamic movement. Though under the Top Gear brand, it plays closer to *Excitebike* and *Moto Racer*, offering gritty arcade-style action with a short but satisfying progression loop.
