## 🕹️ Game Description
When the Primagen's Lightship was destroyed in *Turok 2*, it caused a shockwave that nearly obliterated Oblivion — an entity that drifts through space consuming all in its path. In the aftermath, a new world forms, home to the Turok bloodline. Oblivion aims to wipe it out. In this third installment, players choose between Danielle Fireseed and her brother Joseph, each offering unique paths, tools, and gameplay styles. Danielle’s grappling hook accesses high routes, while Joseph’s agility lets him slip through vents. Weapon upgrades vary per character, featuring napalm shells or electrical ricochets. No keys this time — levels flow linearly, with detailed in-game cutscenes and a robust multiplayer mode including bots and character-specific weapon sets.
