## 🕹️ Game Description
<em><strong>The New Tetris</strong></em> revitalizes the iconic block-dropping formula with new mechanics and multiplayer chaos. Featuring “Spin Moves” and the ability to swap out undesired shapes with a “Hold Piece,” players can chain combos to form Mono- and Multi-Squares — which yield massive point boosts and visual fireworks. Multiplayer mode introduces strategic sabotage where dumped garbage blocks disrupt opponents mid-stack. With sleek visuals, world monument backgrounds, and hypnotic ambient music, the game captures a surreal and competitive vibe unlike any other Tetris variant on console.

## 🛫 Nintendo Gateway System
This game was also available from The <strong>Nintendo Gateway System</strong> specialised for airlines and hotels. As part of a partnership between Nintendo and LodgeNet from late 1993 up until the late 2000s, about 40,000 airline seats and 955,000 hotel rooms featured a modified version of the game. LodgeNet partnered with Nintendo to bring video games directly into guest hotel rooms through streaming over the LodgeNet server, with the special LodgeNet controller plugging directly into the television or LodgeNet set-top box, transmitting the game over phone lines connected to a central game server. Pricing was usually $6.95 plus tax for 1 hour of video games. After 1 hour, the game would immediately stop and prompt the user to purchase more play time. Many games were modified for single-player play only.
