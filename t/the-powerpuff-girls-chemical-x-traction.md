## 🕹️ Game Description
<em><strong>The Powerpuff Girls: Chemical X-Traction</strong></em> drops Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup into a 3D arena brawler where Chemical X must be reclaimed from Mojo Jojo and a roster of villains. Players fight across themed environments with throwable objects, health meters, and super attacks tied to Chemical X pickups. Win two out of three rounds to advance through story mode, or challenge a friend in head-to-head multiplayer. Though gameplay is light on complexity, it showcases character voice clips and slapstick power-ups faithful to the cartoon’s chaotic charm.
