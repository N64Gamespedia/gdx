## 🕹️ Game Description
<em><strong>Top Gear Rally 2</strong></em> builds on the original with a full rally championship structure, letting players join professional racing teams and earn sponsorship money to repair and upgrade cars. Damage affects performance — from tires to engines — and repairs subtract from winnings. Better results unlock new team contracts, faster vehicles, and expanded rally events. The game supports 2-player co-op championship mode and up to 4-player split-screen arcade races. A deeper, strategic rally experience wrapped in dusty turns and team mechanics.
