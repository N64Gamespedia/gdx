## 🕹️ Game Description
<em><strong>Tom and Jerry in Fists of Furry</strong></em> delivers slapstick arena brawling with a cast pulled straight from the iconic cartoon series. Players choose characters like Tom, Jerry, Butch, and Spike, then fight one-on-one or in tag-team tournaments across destructible environments inspired by classic episodes. Weapons — including shovels, frying pans, bombs, and even fruit — can be picked up mid-match and hurled for chaotic effect. Arenas are laced with traps, interactive objects, and unpredictable AI behavior, capturing the spirit of cartoon mayhem in a surprisingly robust fighter for younger players and retro fans alike.
