## 🕹️ Game Description
<em><strong>Toon Panic</strong></em> was a four-player arena brawler developed by Bottom Up, aiming to evoke the chaotic charm of *Power Stone* and *Rakugaki Showtime*. The game was cancelled mid-development when the studio went bankrupt, but a prototype surfaced years later via Japanese auction and was leaked publicly by Team CARROT / No-Intro. The build includes a stylish intro, catchy music, rudimentary debug options, and a multiplayer mode — though AI is absent and most features remain unfinished. Character select screen placeholders feature art from *Final Fantasy VIII*, highlighting its surreal dev stage quirks. A bizarre and rare preservation artifact from N64’s hidden vault.
