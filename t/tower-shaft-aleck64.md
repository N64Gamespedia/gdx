## 🕹️ Game Description
<em><strong>Tower & Shaft</strong></em> delivers two modes of vertical puzzle gameplay: <strong>Shaft</strong> challenges you to fall through platforms and stay ahead of a descending screen — miss and you lose a life. <strong>Tower</strong> flips the action, requiring timed jumps with a fluctuating power meter to reach higher floors. Lose momentum and fall off-screen? Life lost. You get two lives per credit, with respawns starting ten floors below death point. Though menus and story are in Japanese, the core gameplay is intuitive. A rare Aleck64 arcade title, preserved via emulation for collectors and enthusiasts.

*Tower & Shaft* has been fan-translated into English by [Zoinkity](https://www.romhacking.net/community/803/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}. The patch uses the `.xdelta` format and was released on February 4, 2019.  
This series of patches localizes the Aleck64 title “Tower & Shaft” to North American English and optionally modifies it to run on Nintendo 64 hardware. A revised cartridge conversion method is used, consistent with later conversion releases. This should act as a replacement for the original N64 conversion release.
