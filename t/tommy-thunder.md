## 🕹️ Game Description
<em><strong>Tommy Thunder</strong></em> was a third-person shooter developed for the Nintendo 64 and intended for PlayStation, created by Player 1 Studios. Though unreleased, a prototype surfaced in 2016 through herpetic.adventures, showcasing a minimalist demo build. Gameplay is limited and rough, but the concept featured action-platform shooting across industrial environments. With placeholder textures and minimal UI, it remains more curiosity than complete experience — offering a glimpse into early-stage development for fans of unreleased games and console preservationists.
