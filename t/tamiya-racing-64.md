## 🕹️ Game Description
<em><strong>Tamiya Racing 64</strong></em> is a never-released prototype racing game featuring licensed remote-controlled cars from the popular Tamiya brand. Developed as a tech demo with ultra-sensitive steering and quirky engine sounds, it simulates RC racing with vacuum-like acceleration effects and sharp turns. Though often confused with *Mini Racers*, the game stands apart for its simplified UI and early-stage assets. Dumped and released by Team CARROT in 2012, it remains one of the rarest glimpses into N64-era RC simulations.
