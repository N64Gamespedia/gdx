## 🕹️ Game Description
<em><strong>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2</strong></em> builds on the success of its predecessor with new tricks, iconic skate legends, and custom park creation. Players can perform manuals to extend combos, edit trick lists, and customize their own skaters. Skate global venues or create original ramps, gaps, and rails to share with others. Expanded goals and unlockables add depth to career mode, while multiplayer brings head-to-head contests across grinds and vert ramps. With its fluid controls and hard-hitting soundtrack, it's a genre-defining entry that raised the bar for extreme sports games.
