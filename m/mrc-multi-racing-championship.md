## 🕹️ Game Description
Featuring up to 10 selectable cars — many unlocked through progression — and three main courses with mirrored variants, Multi-Racing Championship delivers a surprisingly deep driving experience. Each track offers branching paths with terrain choices like dirt, snow, or paved roads, and each vehicle handles differently depending on the surface. From off-road trucks to slick street racers, players can tune their rides to suit the terrain and master shortcuts across dynamic environments.
