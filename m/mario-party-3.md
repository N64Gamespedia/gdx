## 🕹️ Game Description
Mario and friends are throwing a party and you're invited. It's their biggest bash yet, with seventy totally new Mini-Games and five brand new adventure boards. You'll be the life of the party as you punch, pound and stampede right over your opponents in a multiplayer melee or go head-to-head in the new two-player duel mode. You can even unlock new characters in the one-player challenge. With so much fun and excitement, this is a bash you'll just have to crash!

This game was also available from The **Nintendo Gateway System** specialised for airlines and hotels. As part of a partnership between Nintendo and LodgeNet from late 1993 up until the late 2000s, about 40,000 airline seats and 955,000 hotel rooms featured a modified version of the game. LodgeNet partnered with Nintendo to bring video games directly into guest hotel rooms through streaming over the LodgeNet server, with the special LodgeNet controller plugging directly into the television or LodgeNet set-top box, transmitting the game over phone lines connected to a central game server. Pricing was usually $6.95 plus tax for 1 hour of video games. After 1 hour, the game would immediately stop and prompt the user to purchase more play time. Many games were modified for single-player play only.
