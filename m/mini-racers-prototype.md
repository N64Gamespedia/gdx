## 🕹️ Game Description
*Mini Racers* was a canceled multiplayer racing game developed for the Nintendo 64. Originally announced in 1998, it featured toy car chaos for up to four players — in the vein of *Micro Machines* and *RC Pro-Am*. Early builds drew criticism for clunky camera angles, but Spaceworld 1999 revealed improvements with configurable top-down views. Sadly, it was shelved during the final N64 days, just ahead of the 128-bit console wave. Thankfully, Team Carrot released the prototype publicly in 2012.
