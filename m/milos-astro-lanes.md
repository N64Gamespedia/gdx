## 🕹️ Game Description
Bowl with a Nuclear Ball on an alien’s tongue — yes, you read that right. *Milo’s Astro Lanes* takes the future of bowling to deep space madness. Choose from a cosmic arsenal: the Pea Ball, Cosmic Slime, White Dwarf, and more. Wacky lanes, up to four players, and outrageous power-ups make this a standout multiplayer party blast on the N64.

This game was also available from The **Nintendo Gateway System** specialised for airlines and hotels. As part of a partnership between Nintendo and LodgeNet from late 1993 up until the late 2000s, about 40,000 airline seats and 955,000 hotel rooms featured a modified version of the game. LodgeNet partnered with Nintendo to bring video games directly into guest hotel rooms through streaming over the LodgeNet server, with the special LodgeNet controller plugging directly into the television or LodgeNet set-top box, transmitting the game over phone lines connected to a central game server. Pricing was usually $6.95 plus tax for 1 hour of video games. After 1 hour, the game would immediately stop and prompt the user to purchase more play time. Many games were modified for single-player play only.  
This version however, was not found and converted for use on the N64 system.
