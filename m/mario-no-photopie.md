## 🕹️ Game Description
Mario no Photopi (マリオのふぉとぴー Mario no Fotopī?) is a creativity video game released for the Nintendo 64 in 1998 exclusively in Japan. The game's cartridge has two SmartMedia card slots in the top to import digital photos and other graphics. Pictures created in the game can be saved to the memory card and would work with any digital printing display located in many malls and large scale stores. The cards could even be sent away like any other film processing. The game is compatible with the N64 mouse, which came with Mario Artist: Paint Studio. Even in Japan, the game is widely unheard of, making it a very popular game amongst collectors, and the fact that it is the only game to use the Smart Media-ready cartridge makes it that much more sought after. The unique cartridge has a Model Number of NUS-023. To date, it is known to have had three Smart Media cards that were specially made for it in connection with video game themes; Sylvanian Families characters from the toy line, Bomberman, and Yoshi.
