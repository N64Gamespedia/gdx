## üïπÔ∏è Game Description
Excitebike 64 is an update to the original Excitebike for the NES. The outrageous jumps and precision timing required in the original have been translated into a modern 3D racing game. There are several game modes to choose from. First, there is a season mode with multiple skill levels. Completing a 5-race season in first place unlocks special tracks and more difficult classes. Second, there is a exhibition mode which allows you and up to 3 other people to choose a single track to race on. Third, there is a time trial mode in which you try to get the best times on the 20 tracks. Finally, there are multiple special tracks. Some of the special tracks include a point-to-point race through the desert, a hill-climb competition, motocross soccer, and a pixel-perfect conversion of the original Excitebike. Excitebike 64 also includes a track editor for building your own competitions.

This game was also available through the Nintendo Gateway System, a specialized platform for airlines and hotels. As part of a partnership between Nintendo and LodgeNet from late 1993 up until the late 2000s, about 40,000 airline seats and 955,000 hotel rooms featured a modified version of the game. LodgeNet partnered with Nintendo to bring video games directly into guest hotel rooms through streaming over the LodgeNet server, with the special LodgeNet controller plugging directly into the television or LodgeNet set-top box, transmitting the game over phone lines connected to a central game server. Pricing was usually $6.95 plus tax for 1 hour of video games. After 1 hour, the game would immediately stop and prompt the user to purchase more play time. Many games were modified for single-player play only.
