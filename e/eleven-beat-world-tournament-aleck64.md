## 🕹️ Game Description
Eleven Beat: World Tournament was the first Aleck 64 release and it's definitely one of the better games for the system. This soccer game takes place in a cartoony world with a total of 16 teams featured. You pick your team and then work your way up the tournament ladder scoring more goals than your opponents until you eventually make it to the top. The game is fast-paced and a real blast to play through. It can also be played with a second player, just be sure to hit the Start button on the player 2's controller. In the single player mode each half lasts 1:40 and requires another credit to play the second half of the game. In the two player mode the halves last 2:20 and the game even goes to a shootout mode if you're tied at the end. This game requires no knowledge of the Japanese language to play as all the text and voice samples in this game are in English.
