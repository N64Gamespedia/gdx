## üïπÔ∏è Game Description

_**Aerogauge**_ is a futuristic hovercraft racing game developed by Locomotive and published by ASCII Entertainment. Often compared to *Wipeout* and *Extreme-G*, it features airborne vehicles called Aero Machines that race across gravity-defying tracks filled with loops, tunnels, and alternate routes.

Players choose from ten Aero Machines, each with unique stats for speed, acceleration, shield, and agility. The game includes four initial tracks with two unlockables, and modes like Grand Prix, Time Trial, and VS. Despite its ambitious concept, *Aerogauge* was criticized for excessive pop-up, lack of weapons, and steep difficulty ‚Äî but it remains a cult curiosity for fans of sci-fi racers.
