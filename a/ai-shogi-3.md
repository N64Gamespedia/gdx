## üïπÔ∏è Game Description
<b>
_**AI Shogi 3**_ is a traditional Japanese board game simulation released exclusively in Japan for the Nintendo 64. Developed and published by I4, it offers a minimalist digital version of Shogi ‚Äî often referred to as Japanese chess.

The game includes basic features such as CPU vs. player matches, customizable backgrounds, and editable starting piece positions. A helpful addition is the ability to preview legal moves for each piece, making it slightly more accessible than earlier Shogi titles. While it lacks tutorials or flashy presentation, it remains a niche curiosity for fans of strategic board games.
