## 🕹️ Game Description  
<em><strong>Armorines: Project S.W.A.R.M.</strong></em> is a first-person shooter with some on-rail segments. The game features five different environments set on Earth and in space, and offers two playable characters: <strong>Tony Lewis</strong> and <strong>Myra Lane</strong>. Each character starts with a unique weapon — Tony uses a slower but stronger gun, while Myra uses a faster machine gun-like weapon that deals less damage.

Additional weapons can be picked up throughout the game. Each character has access to 3 weapons, while there are 5 special weapons exclusive to specific environments. These special weapons can be powered up three times within their respective zones.

<em>Armorines</em> includes a co-op campaign and a multiplayer versus mode. The versus mode supports up to 4 players, while the co-op mode supports 2 players.
