## 🕹️ Game Description:

<em><strong>Army Men: Sarge's Heroes 2</strong></em> a third-person shooter video game developed and published by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_3DO_Company" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The 3DO Company</a> for Nintendo 64. Unlike the previous game which was more dark in tone, this game has more of a lighthearted storyline. The plastic war is almost over, general Plastro is frozen and the green army men only need to find the tan Lieutenant and make him write the peace treaty. But a blue spy unfreezes Plastro. Plastro is now trying to defeat the green (or maybe the blue, too). Now Sarge and his crew have to defeat the tan and capture Plastro<em>.</em>
