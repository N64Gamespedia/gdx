## üïπÔ∏è Game Description
<b>
_**A Bug's Life**_ is a 3D platformer based on the Disney/Pixar film of the same name. Players take control of Flik, a clever ant who must save his colony from a gang of greedy grasshoppers. The game features 15 levels with objectives tied to the movie‚Äôs storyline, including collecting grain, spelling out F-L-I-K, and defeating enemy bugs.

Gameplay includes transforming seeds into helpful plants, upgrading berries as weapons, and navigating muted environments that loosely resemble scenes from the film. While the game received mixed reviews, it remains a nostalgic entry in the N64 library for fans of the movie.
