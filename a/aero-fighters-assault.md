## 🕹️ Game Description
<em><strong>Aero Fighters Assault</strong></em>, known in Japan as <em><strong>Sonic Wings Assault</strong></em> (ソニックウィングス アサルト), is an arcade-style combat flight simulator developed by Paradigm Entertainment and published by Video System for the Nintendo 64. It was released in Japan on October 30, 1997, in North America on November 21, 1997, and in Europe on April 12, 1998.

This was the first and only entry in the <em>Aero Fighters</em> series to feature 3D graphics, and the final title before Video System filed for bankruptcy in 2001. Players control one of four pilots tasked with defeating a fictional world-dominating organization called Phutta Morgana. The game includes single-player missions, bonus unlockables, and a two-player deathmatch mode.
