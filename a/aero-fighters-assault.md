## üïπÔ∏è Game Description
<b>
_**Aero Fighters Assault**_, known in Japan as _**Sonic Wings Assault**_ („ÇΩ„Éã„ÉÉ„ÇØ„Ç¶„Ç£„É≥„Ç∞„Çπ „Ç¢„Çµ„É´„Éà), is an arcade-style combat flight simulator developed by [Paradigm Entertainment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm_Entertainment){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} and published by [Video System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_System){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} for the Nintendo 64.

This title marks the sixth and final game in the *Aero Fighters* (or *Sonic Wings*) series ‚Äî and its only entry rendered in full 3D. Players take control of one of four unique pilots battling a fictional terrorist syndicate called Phutta Morgana across missions featuring dogfights, bomb runs, and air-to-ground combat. Though its reception was mixed, it stands as the swan song of Video System before their closure in 2001.
